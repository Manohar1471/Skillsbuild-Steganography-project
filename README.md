Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret data or objects.
In the context of digital images, it involves concealing a secret message within an image file in such a way that the presence of the message is not apparent. 
The Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique is one of the simplest methods for embedding data into an image.
